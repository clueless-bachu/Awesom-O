## Overview

Awesom-O is an autonomous threat detection and response robot whoâ€™s main objective is to de-tect threats and accordingly eliminate them.  The robot scans the environment, detects potentialthreats which are marked with an AruCo marker.  The Awesom-O then proceeds to autonomouslynavigate towards the object of interest (or threat) while avoiding collision with other obstacles inthe  environment.   When  it  is  within  a  certain  radius  of  the  object  of  interest,  it  disarms  it  andmoves on to its next target, thus eliminating all threats in the environment

We intend on creating a robust set of test cases with:

- cmake
- gtest
- rostest

## Dependencies

* Ubuntu 18.04 (Operating System)
* Modern C++ 11(Programming Language)
* CMake (Build System)
* OpenCV >= 4.4

## Standard install via command-line

```
cd <<Your_catkin_workspace>>/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/snehanyk05/Awesom-O/
cd ../..
catkin_make
```

## Building for code coverage
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.


## Generate Doxygen Documentation

To install doxygen run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
Now from the cloned directory run:
```
doxygen doxygen
```

Generated doxygen files are in html format and you can find them in ./docs folder. With the following command
```
cd docs
cd html
google-chrome index.html
