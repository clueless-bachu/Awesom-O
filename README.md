## Overview

Awesom-O is an autonomous threat detection and response robot whoâ€™s main objective is to de-tect threats and accordingly eliminate them.  The robot scans the environment, detects potentialthreats which are marked with an AruCo marker.  The Awesom-O then proceeds to autonomouslynavigate towards the object of interest (or threat) while avoiding collision with other obstacles inthe  environment.   When  it  is  within  a  certain  radius  of  the  object  of  interest,  it  disarms  it  andmoves on to its next target, thus eliminating all threats in the environment

We intend on creating a robust set of test cases with:

- cmake
- gtest
- rostest

## Dependencies

* Ubuntu 18.04 (Operating System)
* Modern C++ 11(Programming Language)
* CMake (Build System)
* OpenCV >= 4.4 with dnn and tracking library

## Instructions to install Opencv4.4

```
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
cd opencv
git checkout 4.4.0
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
cd opencv_contrib
git checkout 4.4.0
cd ..
cd opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
-D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF \
-D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=OFF \
-D WITH_TBB=ON \
-D WITH_V4L=ON \
-D WITH_QT=ON \
-D WITH_OPENGL=ON \
-D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules \
-D BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF ..

make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo sh -c "echo '/usr/local/lib' >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf"
sudo ldconfig 
```
## Standard install via command-line

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/snehanyk05/Awesom-O/
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
Run program: ./app/shell-app 
```

## Building for code coverage (for assignments beginning in Week 4)
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.


## Generate Doxygen Documentation

To install doxygen run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
Now from the cloned directory run:
```
doxygen doxygen
```

Generated doxygen files are in html format and you can find them in ./docs folder. With the following command
```
cd docs
cd html
google-chrome index.html
